## Learning Goal

Understand the mechanics of the `useReducer()` hook.

## Code walkthrough

### App Component

In the **src/** folder :

- **app.jsx** returns one component called `DateCounter`. We will be working on this component

#### The useReducer hook

[`useReducer`](https://react.dev/reference/react/useReducer#dispatch) :

- is a React Hook designed to manage complex state.

- is usually called with two arguments :

1. `reducer`: The reducer function specifies how the state gets updated. It must be pure, should take the `state` and `action` as arguments, and should return the next state. State and action can be of any types.

2. `initialArg`: The value from which the initial state is calculated. It can be a value of any type.

- returns an array with exactly two values :

1. The current state. During the first render, it‚Äôs set to `initialArg`.

2. The `dispatch` function that lets you update the state to a different value and trigger a re-render.

In **app.jsx**, let's call `useReducer()` :

```jsx
function reducer(state, action) {
  console.log(`state: ${state}`, `action: ${action}`)
}

export function DateCounter() {
  const [count, dispatch] = useReducer(reducer, 0)

  const inc = function () {
    dispatch(1)
  }
}
```

- We called useReducer with a reducer function that logs to the console the the `state` and the `action` arguments.

- We also called the dispatch function in the `inc` event handler, and we passed to it the number `1` as argument.

In the browser, we should get this output :

![Console](../01-dateCounter/assets/console-.png)

We can see that :

- the state is `0` because the initialState was set to `0`

```jsx
const [count, dispatch] = useReducer(reducer, 0)
```

- the action is `1` because it is the argument passed to the `dispatch` function.

As mentionned above, the `reducer` function specifies how the state gets updated.
If we wanted to update the current state (which is `0` at the moment) we can do this :

```jsx
function reducer(state, action) {
  return state + action
}
...
```

When we click on the increment button, the counter should increment by 1 :

![increm](../01-dateCounter/assets/incrementbyone.gif)

As we can see the reducer calculates the new state based on the action it receives from the `dispatch` function.
The state was `0` and the action received was `1`, `0 + 1 = 1`, therefore `1` is rendered on the screen.

#### What is an action ?

An `action` is usually a plain JavaScript object that represents an intention to change the state. Action objects usually have a `type` property with a user-defined string value that describes the action being taken. Optional properties can be added to the action object. One common property added is conventionally called `payload`, which is used to supply data necessary to perform the desired action.

In our example, we can define three actions:

1. Increment the counter
2. Decrement the counter
3. Setting the counter

One common convention is to use a [switch statement](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Statements/switch) to define the `reducer` logic :

```jsx
function reducer(state, action) {
  switch (action.type) {
    case 'increment':
      return state + 1
    case 'decrement':
      return state - 1
    case 'setCount':
      return action.payload
    default:
      throw new Error('Invalid action')
  }
}
export function DateCounter() {
  ...

 const inc = function () {
    dispatch({ type: 'increment' })
  }
  const dec = function () {
    dispatch({ type: 'decrement' })
  }

  const defineCount = function (e) {
    dispatch({ type: 'setCount', payload: Number(e.target.value) })
  }
}
```

- The `reducer` function takes the current state and the action object passed to the `dispatch` functions inside `inc`, `dec` and `defineCount` event handlers and calculates the next state.

In our example:

- When the action's type is `increment`, we increase the current state by `1`.
- When the action's type is `decrement`, we decrease the current state by `1`.
- When the action's type is `setCount`, we set the counter to the number entered by the user, which is saved in the `payload` property.

##### Managing related pieces of state

The `useReducer()` hook allows us to have a centralized container for state that is shared across the entire application, with rules ensuring that the state can only be updated in a predictable fashion using events called `actions`.

For our component `DateCounter`, we have two pieces of state :

1. step
2. count

```jsx
export function DateCounter() {
  const [count, setCount] = useState(0)
  const [step, setStep] = useState(1)
}
```

We can put these related pieces of state in a separate object called `initialState` :

```jsx
const initialState = {
  step: 1,
  count: 0,
}
```

and pass `initialState` to the useReducer() hook :

```jsx
const [state, dispatch] = useReducer(reducer, initialState)
```

We can also immediately destructure `initialState` :

```jsx
const { count, step } = state
```

Now back to our reducer function, as mentionned above, reducers must follow certain rules:

1. They should only calculate the new state value based on the state and action arguments

2. They are not allowed to modify the existing state. Instead, they must make immutable updates, by copying the existing state and making changes to the copied values.

3. They must not do any asynchronous logic or other ‚Äúside effects‚Äù

These rules help improve useReducer‚Äôs scaleable and predictable state management. Some common behaviors to avoid inside reducers are network requests, generating random numbers, and using asynchronous functions.

We can update our reducer function like so :

```jsx
function reducer(state, action) {
  switch (action.type) {
    case 'increment':
      return { ...state, count: state.count + 1 }
    case 'decrement':
      return { ...state, count: state.count - 1 }
    case 'setCount':
      return { ...state, count: action.payload }
    default:
      throw new Error('Invalid action')
  }
}
```

The counter still works exactly like before :

![counter](../01-dateCounter/assets/incrementbyone.gif)

To comply with the second rule (performing an immutable update ) the `initialState` object‚Äôs contents was copied into a new object and only this copy was mutated.
In Javascript, we can use the [spread operator](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Operators/Spread_syntax) to obtain copies of objects and arrays.

Next, let's try and implement the `step` feature.
We want to be able to choose the number of steps our counter will increment or decrement.
With our new reducer implementation, it's very easy:

- Inside `defineStep()` event handler we can dispatch an action called `step` to capture the number of steps we will increment or decrement using the **event object**. The **value** will be saved in the `payload` property. We should also convert the **value** to a number using **Number()**:

```js
const defineStep = function (e) {
  dispatch({ type: 'step', payload: Number(e.target.value) })
}
```

- Then, we can create a new case in our reducer function to handle this action (event):

```js
function reducer(state, action) {
...
 case 'step':
      return { ...state, step: action.payload }
...
}
```

- and finally, using the current `step` state, we can increase or decrease the counter :

```js
function reducer(state, action) {
...
 case 'increment':
      return { ...state, count: state.count + state.step }
    case 'decrement':
      return { ...state, count: state.count - state.step }
...
}
```

![Steps](../01-dateCounter/assets/steps.gif)

The last feature to implement is `reset`. We want to be able to reset the counter to `0` and the number of steps to `1` :

- We can accomplish this by dispatching an action called `reset` inside `reset()` event handler :

```js
const reset = function () {
  dispatch({ type: 'reset' })
}
```

- In our reducer, if a `reset` action is dispatched, we want to return the `initialState`

```js
const initialState = {
  step: 1,
  count: 0,
}
function reducer(state, action) {
...
 case 'reset':
      return initialState
...
}
```

Let's reset our counter :

#### Summary

To recap :

- Why should we use the `useReducer()` hook? :

In certain situations when state management with `useState` is not enough. For example :

1. when components have a lots of state variables and state updates spread across many event handlers all over the component or multiple components

2. when multiple state updates needs to happen simultaneously (our `reset` feature for example, we need to update the `step` and the `count` state simutaneously).

3. when updating one piece of state depends on one or multiple other piece of states.

For all these scenarios, you should consider using the `useReducer` hook.

- How does `useReducer()` hook work? :

1. We call `useReducer()` with a reducer function and it's initial state. It returns a `state` and a `dispatch` function:

```jsx
const [state, dispatch] = useReducer(reducer, initialState)
```

2. The initial state should contain related pieces of state and is usually stored in a plain javascript object:

```jsx
const initialState = {
  step: 1,
  count: 0,
}
```

3. The `reducer()` function is the central place where all the state's changes happen. Moving state updates from the event handlers to this central place, allows us to **decouple the state's update logic from the component** which makes our application easier to understand. In practice, it is a pure function that **takes two arguments**: the current state and an object representing an `action` performed by the user and **returns the next state** :

```jsx
function reducer(state, action) {
  switch (action.type) {
    case 'increment':
      return { ...state, count: state.count + state.step }
   ...
    case 'reset':
      return initialState
    default:
      throw new Error('Invalid action')
  }
}
```

- How do we trigger a state update? :

This is where the `dispatch()` function comes in. The dispatch function sends actions from the event handlers to the reducer. This function takes one argument: the `action` object that describes how to update the state. Action objects usually have a `type` property with a string value that describes the action being taken and an optional property called `payload` that stores data needed to perform the state update:

```jsx
dispatch({ type: 'step', payload: Number(e.target.value) })
```

Let's take a look at the example below:

![Diagram](../01-dateCounter/assets/update-state-diagram-use-reducer.png)

- In an event handler, we call the dispatch function that was returned by `useReducer()` in order to dispatch an action to a reducer.

- The action contains information about how to update the state. In our diagram, the `type` is **updateDay** and the `payload` is **23**, which means that, we want to set the `date` state to **23**.

- The reducer takes the action and the current state and returns **the next state**

- And finally, as always, state updates trigger a component's **re-render**.
